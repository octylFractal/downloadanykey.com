downloadanykey.com
==================
A (fake) site about downloading an Any Key, because apparently no one has one?

# Testing
This site uses IPFS, run `upload.sh` to publish it to IPFS, and then you can browse it.

The canonical DNS name uses DNSLink to point to the canonical version of this site.
